[h1]Watch out it&apos;s Shia Labeouf![/h1]

This mod adds a new incident to the game - &quot;Shia Surprise&quot;. A wild Shia will immediately attack your colony, he carries a unique bloody axe which he will not hessitate to use on your colonists.
While he may not prove a threat to well established colonies his armor and high melee stat should not be taken lightly. Brave colonist may even attempt to capture your own Shia. What you do with him is up to you but bewarned he is notoriously hard to recruit.

[b]But where&apos;s the music?[/b]
It&apos;s a copy-righted song so I&apos;m not uploading it to the workshop. 
However if you do happen to own a copy of the song, you can add it by replacing the shia.wav found in the &quot;/Sounds&quot; folder for this mod. 

This event can be manually initiated through the debug menu under incidents if you feel impatient.

If this reference is lost on you, checkout the video above.

Author&apos;s Note: All credit for original development of this mod goes to Sectoid. I just updated this mod for 1.0 with their permission. In addition i have made Shia a tad more deadly in this 1.0 edition.
